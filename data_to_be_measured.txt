Measurement interval in all cities is 15 minutes, while the number of measurements during the day and night varies. Some cities in the reports of a systematic measurement noise have data on two measurements during a day (6-18h), one during the evening (18-22h) and two during the night (22-6h), while some reports have data about a day and night measurements noise.
Numeric values that are shown in the reports are:
 1. the value of daily noise indicators (Lday) in the
environment;
 2. the value of the indicator evening noise (Levening) in
the environment;
 3. the value of the indicator nighttime noise (Lnight) in
the environment;
 4. the value of the total noise indicators (Lden) in the
environment;
 5. percentage of the population endangered by noise
(A%) of road traffic during the day and during the
night and the percentage of the population highly
vulnerable to noise (NA%) (comparing to the
determined value of Lden at measuring points) - Novi
Sad;
 6. the recorded values of the equivalent noise level
(LAeq);
7.  the permissible noise level;
 8. average noise level (day, evening, night) – Kraljevo;
 9. the established value of the frequency for a fixed
maximum equivalent noise level - Novi Sad.
